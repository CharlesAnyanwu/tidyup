Hi Ramin,

Your website is ready and looks great. You can preview it here:
https://valettrash.netlify.app

To make it live at VALETTRASH.ORG, I need you to update your domain settings.


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
───────────────────
Log into wherever you bought VALETTRASH.ORG (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.) and change the nameservers to these:

    dns1.p10.nsone.net
    dns2.p10.nsone.net
    dns3.p10.nsone.net
    dns4.p10.nsone.net

That's it. Save the changes and the site will go live within a few hours (sometimes faster).


IF YOU'RE NOT SURE HOW
──────────────────────
Send me your registrar login info and I can do it for you. Or let me know which company you used to buy the domain and I'll send you step-by-step instructions.


WHAT'S INCLUDED
───────────────
• Website hosted free (no monthly fees)
• SSL certificate (the padlock icon) - included
• Contact form sends emails directly to tidyup@valettrash.org
• Mobile-friendly design


STILL NEEDED FROM YOU
─────────────────────
• Phone number for the website (currently shows placeholder)
• Any social media links you want included


Once DNS is updated, I'll do a final check and set up the contact form notifications so you get emails when someone reaches out.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Charles
