Hi Ramin,

Thanks for the details and the logo—it looks great. I have a clear picture of what you're going for.

Project Scope:
- Single-page landing website for Jacksonville and surrounding counties
- Sections: About/Mission, How It Works (Prep, Recycle, Notify & Collect), Service Area, Contact Form
- Color scheme based on your logo (green bag, yellow/gold glove, black accents)
- Mobile-friendly, fast-loading, professional design
- Contact form that sends inquiries directly to your email

Preview Links:
I've put together a few design directions for you to review. Take a look and let me know which style resonates most with your brand:

Why Custom vs. Template Sites:
I know you can find cheaper options online for $300 or so. Here's the difference:

Those $300 sites are templates with monthly platform fees ($16-50/month). After 2 years, you've paid $700-1,500 and you're still locked into their platform.

What I'm building for you:
- Custom code you own outright (no platform lock-in)
- $0/month hosting forever (Netlify free tier)
- 4 design options to choose from (not just one template)
- Hand-coded for speed and search engines
- Easy to update or modify later

The math: A "cheap" site at $300 + $25/month costs $900 by year 2. My site costs $800 total, and you own everything.

Optional Add-ons:
- Google Business Profile setup: +$100
- Monthly maintenance (content updates, monitoring): $50/month
- Additional pages in the future: $150-300 each

Timeline:
- First draft ready for your review: 2-3 business days
- Revisions and final version: 1-2 business days after feedback
- Total: About 1 week from start to live

What I Still Need From You:
- Domain name (the URL you want, like tidyupjax.com)
- Phone number for the website
- Email address where contact form submissions should go (you'll receive an instant email notification every time someone fills out the contact form)
- Any social media links (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) - if you have them
- Do you have any photos of your team, trucks, or properties you service? Real photos build more trust than stock images, but I can work with what we have.

Let me know which design direction you prefer, and I'll refine it based on your feedback.

Best,
Charles
